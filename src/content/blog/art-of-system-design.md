This is a placeholder for a full blog post about system design. System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. System design could be seen as the application of systems theory to product development. There is some overlap with the disciplines of systems analysis, systems architecture and systems engineering.
